            <section id="introduction">
                <p>As mentors and advisors to startups, it's crucial to use time efficiently and effectively in initial meetings to truly understand the startup's potential, challenges, and needs. The following framework, composed of key questions across several thematic areas, is designed to help mentors quickly assess startups and provide targeted guidance. Here's how other mentors can use these questions to structure productive first meetings with startups.</p>

                <h2>1. Background and Motivation</h2>
                
                <h3>"What inspired you to start your company?"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This question helps you understand the startup's origin story and the passion behind the idea. It reveals the depth of the founders' commitment and their personal connection to the problem they are trying to solve.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to Use It:</strong> Listen for the enthusiasm and conviction in their story. A strong personal motivation often indicates a deeper commitment to seeing the idea through, even when faced with obstacles. Use this understanding to assess whether their motivation aligns with the problem they're addressing and whether it can sustain them through tough times.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>"Was there a particular moment that sparked the idea for your startup?"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This question delves into the specific events or realizations that led to the creation of the startup. It can provide insight into the founders' problem-solving approach and their understanding of the market need.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to Use It:</strong> Encourage the founders to reflect on this moment as a way to validate their business idea. If the spark came from a significant pain point or gap in the market, it's a strong indicator that the idea has potential. Use this to help them refine their value proposition or pivot if necessary.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>"Do you have any hobbies or interests that influence your work?"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This question seeks to find intersections between their personal life and professional pursuits. Often, hobbies can lead to creative thinking and innovation in unexpected ways.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to Use It:</strong> Encourage the founders to draw from these influences in their product development or business strategy. Highlight how their unique perspective could differentiate them in the market or lead to innovation.</li>
