<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>A Guide
for Mentors: Using a Structured Framework to Conduct Productive First Meetings
with Startups</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentors and advisors to startups, it's crucial to use
time efficiently and effectively in initial meetings to truly understand the
startup's potential, challenges, and needs. The following framework, composed
of key questions across several thematic areas, is designed to help mentors
quickly assess startups and provide targeted guidance. Here's how other mentors
can use these questions to structure productive first meetings with startups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>1. Background
and Motivation</span></b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;What inspired you to start your company?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question helps you understand the
      startup's origin story and the passion behind the idea. It reveals the
      depth of the founders' commitment and their personal connection to the
      problem they are trying to solve.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Listen for the enthusiasm and
      conviction in their story. A strong personal motivation often indicates a
      deeper commitment to seeing the idea through, even when faced with
      obstacles. Use this understanding to assess whether their motivation
      aligns with the problem they're addressing and whether it can sustain
      them through tough times.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Was there a particular moment that sparked the
     idea for your startup?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question delves into the specific
      events or realizations that led to the creation of the startup. It can
      provide insight into the founders' problem-solving approach and their
      understanding of the market need.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Encourage the founders to reflect
      on this moment as a way to validate their business idea. If the spark
      came from a significant pain point or gap in the market, it's a strong
      indicator that the idea has potential. Use this to help them refine their
      value proposition or pivot if necessary.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>2. Passions
and Interests</span></b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Outside of work, what are you passionate
     about?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question helps you understand the
      founders on a personal level. Knowing their passions outside of work can
      reveal additional strengths, skills, or perspectives that they bring to
      the startup.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Explore how these passions might
      influence their work or contribute to their startup's culture and brand.
      For instance, if a founder is passionate about sustainability, this could
      inform the company's environmental strategy or product development.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Do you have any hobbies or interests that
     influence your work?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question seeks to find intersections
      between their personal life and professional pursuits. Often, hobbies can
      lead to creative thinking and innovation in unexpected ways.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Encourage the founders to draw from
      these influences in their product development or business strategy.
      Highlight how their unique perspective could differentiate them in the
      market or lead to innovation.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>3. Challenges
and Triumphs</span></b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;What has been the most challenging part of your
     startup journey so far?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question is critical for identifying
      pain points in the startup's development. It provides insight into the
      founders' problem-solving capabilities and their resilience.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Offer targeted advice based on the
      challenges they describe. This could include connecting them with
      resources, suggesting alternative strategies, or sharing experiences from
      other startups. Use this understanding to gauge where they might need the
      most support moving forward.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Can you share a moment of success that felt
     particularly rewarding?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question helps identify what the
      founders consider a win and how they measure success. It also provides
      insight into their progress and what motivates them.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Celebrate these successes and help
      them build on these positive experiences. Encouragement can be powerful,
      especially if they've faced many challenges. Use their successes as a
      foundation to suggest areas for further development or scaling.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>4. Vision
and Goals</span></b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Where do you see your company in the next five
     years?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question assesses the founders'
      long-term vision and ambition. It helps you understand whether they have
      a realistic plan for growth and scaling.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> If their vision is clear and
      achievable, help them map out the steps to get there, including potential
      obstacles and opportunities. If their vision is too vague or overly
      ambitious, work with them to set more concrete goals and milestones. This
      will help them stay focused and aligned with their long-term objectives.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;What impact do you hope your company will have on
     the industry or society?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question uncovers the broader
      purpose of the startup, beyond just making a profit. It reveals whether
      the founders are driven by a mission and how they plan to make a
      difference.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Guide them on how to align their
      business strategy with their desired impact. This might involve refining
      their business model to better serve their mission or identifying
      partnerships that can amplify their impact. Encouraging them to
      communicate this impact effectively can also be crucial for attracting
      investors, customers, and talent.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>5. Learning
and Growth</span></b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;What's one lesson you've learned as a founder
     that you'd share with others?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question highlights the founders'
      reflective practices and their willingness to learn from their
      experiences. It also provides an opportunity for them to articulate key
      insights they've gained.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Encourage them to formalize these
      lessons into their company processes or culture. Sharing these insights
      can also help them mentor their own team or even other startups. A strong
      learning culture is critical for adapting and thriving in the fast-paced startup
      world.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;How do you approach personal and professional
     growth?&quot;</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose:</b> This question helps assess the founders'
      commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement. It can also
      reveal their openness to feedback and mentorship.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>How to Use It:</b> Offer recommendations for
      resources, networks, or practices that align with their growth
      objectives. Encouraging them to prioritize personal and professional
      development can help them build a resilient and adaptive company culture,
      which is crucial for long-term success.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Conclusion</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By using this structured framework, mentors can quickly and
effectively understand the key aspects of a startup's journey, including their
motivations, challenges, vision, and growth potential. Each question is
designed to elicit deep insights, allowing mentors to provide targeted advice
that is both practical and strategic. This approach not only helps in making
the first meeting productive but also lays the foundation for a strong
mentoring relationship that can guide the startup through its subsequent stages
of development. By adopting this framework, other mentors can ensure that their
time with startups is well-spent, leading to more meaningful and impactful
guidance.</p>
