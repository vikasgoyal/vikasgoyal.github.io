          <p>Agentic thinking refers to the mindset and approach in which individuals or systems exhibit autonomy, intentionality, and goal-directed behavior. It emphasizes the capacity to act independently, make decisions, and pursue objectives proactively. This concept is rooted in psychology, particularly in the context of human behavior, but it can also be applied to artificial intelligence and organizational behavior.</p>
