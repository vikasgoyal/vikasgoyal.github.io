    <h1>LLM structured outputs : Anti-Patterns</h1>

    <p>When designing GenAI solutions that leverage structured outputs (like those now supported by OpenAI), it's crucial to avoid certain anti-patterns that could hinder flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. Here are some to consider:</p>

    <h2>1. Over-reliance on Structured Outputs</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tightly coupling your system to structured outputs can limit adaptability, as the GenAI model's structure may evolve or vary depending on new use cases.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A system built solely around structured responses could break if the model’s API changes or introduces variability in the output format.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Build mechanisms that allow for graceful handling of unstructured data or different output formats. Keep integrations modular and adaptable to varying structures.</p>

    <h2>2. Hard-Coding Output Handling</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Hard-coding logic to process specific keys or fields in structured output tightly couples your system to a particular version of the model.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a model’s structured output format evolves (e.g., changes in field names or nesting), hardcoded logic will fail.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use dynamic parsing and validation methods to handle different versions of the output gracefully. Ensure backward compatibility where possible.</p>

    <h2>3. Neglecting Contextual Flexibility</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Structured outputs often reduce the richness of nuanced, context-dependent responses that natural language outputs provide.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Relying solely on structured data may overlook subtleties in conversational AI (e.g., emotions, intent), leading to less effective or rigid interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Maintain a balance between structured data for specific tasks and unstructured data for flexible, nuanced communication. Ensure the system can switch between them when necessary.</p>

    <h2>4. Tight Coupling Between Agents and Structure</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> In agentic systems, having agents rely heavily on specific structured outputs can make it harder to add or modify agents without cascading changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Design agents to communicate in an abstract, schema-agnostic way, allowing the system to integrate diverse models with minimal changes.</p>

    <h2>5. Ignoring Long-term Maintainability</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Frequent updates to structured output formats might require constant rework of the system’s integration layer.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a downstream service consumes only structured output and the format frequently changes, it introduces high maintenance overhead.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Abstract the integration layer and implement automated testing for different versions of the output, so that the system can adapt to changes with minimal manual intervention.</p>

    <h2>6. Underutilizing Hybrid Approaches</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Over-emphasizing structured output could overlook scenarios where both structured and unstructured responses are useful.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Consider hybrid approaches that utilize structured data where necessary (for accuracy or downstream integration) but allow unstructured, human-like responses in other contexts (like customer support or creative tasks).</p>

    <h2>7. Assuming Output Completeness</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Assuming that structured outputs will always cover all use cases leads to fragile systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Design systems with fallbacks for cases where the output is incomplete or where edge cases occur, to avoid unexpected failures in production.</p>

    <p>By keeping these anti-patterns in mind, you can design GenAI solutions that are more flexible, maintainable, and capable of evolving with the technology.</p>
