          <h2>Why Trust Matters</h2>
          <p>Trust is the foundation of any relationship, professional or personal. In the workplace, trust drives collaboration, increases efficiency, and reduces friction. People want to work with those they can rely on, whether it's their colleagues, managers, or service providers. In your career, being a trustworthy individual creates a reputation that precedes you, attracting opportunities and support.</p>
          <p>Trust is not just about reliability; it's about character and capability. It answers the fundamental question: <em>Can I depend on this person to act with competence and integrity?</em></p>
