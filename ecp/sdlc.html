          <h1>A Simple Guide to Software Development Lifecycle for High Schoolers</h1>
          
          <p class="accent-text">Software development may sound complex, but it's something you can understand with the right approach. In fact, when creating software, there are just two main stages you need to focus on: <strong>Define</strong> and <strong>Develop</strong>. Let's break these down and see how you can plan, build, and test software!</p>
        </header>
        
        <section id="define-stage">
          <h2>1. Define</h2>
          <p>This is the stage where you decide <strong>what you want to build</strong> and <strong>how you're going to build it</strong>. Here's where all the planning happens. In this stage, you go through three important activities:</p>
          
          <h3>What happens in Define?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ideation</strong>: Think of an idea! What problem does your software solve? Maybe it's a game, a productivity tool, or something that helps people learn.</li>
            <li><strong>Research</strong>: Look at similar software. What features do they have? How can yours be better?</li>
            <li><strong>Design</strong>: Plan how your software will look and work. This can include sketching what each screen will look like and deciding how users will interact with it.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Key Point to Remember: Your software should be useful.</h3>
          <p>For your software to be useful, it should have at least one of these attributes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Saves time (like a calculator app).</li>
            <li>Saves money (like a budgeting tool).</li>
            <li>Saves effort (like a task automation app).</li>
            <li>Helps in socializing (like a chat app).</li>
            <li>Helps in learning (like an educational app).</li>
            <li>Entertaining (like a game or video app).</li>
            <li>Any other useful feature.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Define Stage Checklist:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Is your idea clear?</li>
            <li>What problem will your software solve?</li>
            <li>Have you researched similar apps?</li>
            <li>Have you planned how your software will look?</li>
            <li>How will your software be useful?</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="develop-stage">
          <h2>2. Develop</h2>
          <p>Once your plan is in place, it's time to build the software. This stage involves <strong>writing the code</strong> and making sure everything works properly. It also includes <strong>testing</strong> to catch any errors and <strong>publishing</strong> so people can use your software.</p>
          
          <h3>What happens in Develop?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Coding</strong>: Write the code that makes your software work. If it's a game, this would be programming the game mechanics. If it's a learning app, it would be coding how information is presented.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing</strong>: Try your software to make sure everything works correctly. If there are errors (bugs), you'll need to fix them.</li>
            <li><strong>Publishing</strong>: Once everything works, your software is ready to be published! This could mean making it available on an app store or just sharing it with your friends.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Key Point to Remember: Your software should be usable.</h3>
          <p>For your software to be usable, it should have some of these attributes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy to use (like a simple, straightforward design).</li>
            <li>Fast (loads quickly and responds quickly).</li>
            <li>Appropriate look and feel (it should look professional and match the purpose).</li>
            <li>Adaptive (works on different devices, like phones and computers).</li>
            <li>Personalized (lets users customize their experience).</li>
            <li>Secure (keeps user data safe).</li>
            <li>Any other usability feature.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Develop Stage Checklist:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Is your code working as expected?</li>
            <li>Have you tested for bugs?</li>
            <li>Is your software easy to use?</li>
            <li>Does it load and run quickly?</li>
            <li>Does it look and feel good?</li>
            <li>Is it secure?</li>
            <li>Is your software ready for others to use?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Example to Help You Understand</h2>
          <p>Let's say you want to build a <strong>study planner app</strong> for students.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>In the <strong>Define</strong> stage, you decide that your app will help students plan their homework and study time more efficiently, saving them time and effort. You research similar apps and see that many planners are too complicated. You sketch a simple interface where students can easily drag and drop their tasks into their calendar.</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Develop</strong> stage, you write the code that allows users to create tasks and assign them to specific dates. You test the app to ensure it works on both phones and computers. You also make sure it runs fast and keeps student data secure. Once everything is working, you publish it and let students download it to improve their study habits.</li>

          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>This simple breakdown of software development should help you understand how apps, games, and websites are created. Start by planning your idea and then move on to building it. Follow these steps, and you'll be on your way to making your own useful and usable software!</p>
