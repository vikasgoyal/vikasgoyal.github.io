        <section id="introduction">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The current paradigm for developing AI agents relies heavily on developers creating and training these agents for end users. While this approach has yielded many functional solutions, it suffers from inherent limitations that make it neither scalable nor sustainable in the long term. The process demands technical expertise, including coding skills, and requires adherence to a full software development lifecycle (SDLC). This not only consumes time and resources but also impedes the agents' ability to quickly adapt to evolving user needs.</p>
          
          <p>Every time new functionality is required, developers must intervene to design, implement, and deploy updates. Such rigidity makes current AI agents less flexible and limits their potential to serve dynamic and diverse user bases. A transformative concept, <em>teachable AI agents</em>, offers a way to bridge this gap by empowering non-developers to directly contribute to the learning and functionality of AI systems. By decentralizing the learning process, teachable agents promise a future where AI systems can evolve in real-time alongside the needs of their users.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="concept">
          <h2>The Concept of Teachable AI Agents</h2>
          <p>Teachable AI agents are designed to be educated and improved by end users or domain experts without requiring specialized technical skills. Instead of relying solely on developers for updates and enhancements, these agents can grow organically by learning through interactions with users and domain-specific inputs. This novel approach shifts the development process towards a collaborative and continuous learning model, fostering adaptability and personalization. The fundamental principle is to make the process of teaching agents as natural and intuitive as possible, leveraging tools, interfaces, and frameworks that simplify the user experience.</p>
          
          <p>Through teachable AI systems, users are no longer passive consumers but active contributors to the growth and evolution of the agents. This shift redefines the traditional boundaries between development and usage, creating a dynamic loop of interaction and improvement. Moreover, these agents can learn incrementally, integrating user feedback to refine their behavior and knowledge base over time.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="teachers">
          <h2>The Role of Non-Developers as Teachers</h2>
          <p>There are two primary categories of teachers in the teachable agent model:</p>
          
          <h3>1. End Users</h3>
          <p>End users are the primary consumers of an AI agent's services. They play a critical role in teaching agents through personalization and contextualization. By providing feedback, correcting mistakes, and guiding agents, end users can shape the behavior of AI systems to better suit their unique preferences and needs. For instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personalizing responses in customer service.</li>
            <li>Contextualizing content delivery in educational platforms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>End users' contributions allow agents to develop a more nuanced understanding of individual requirements. For example, in a customer service scenario, the user might guide an agent to handle specific queries in a particular tone or style, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Domain Experts</h3>
          <p>Domain experts bring specialized knowledge, best practices, and insights to the table. They can teach agents about industry-specific standards, regulatory requirements, and operational nuances. These experts serve as part of the agent's development ecosystem, enriching its knowledge base to perform tasks more effectively. Examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Medical professionals updating a healthcare agent with the latest research.</li>
            <li>Corporate trainers equipping an AI agent with new training protocols.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By integrating expert knowledge, agents can operate at a higher level of competency and deliver more accurate and impactful results. Domain experts also help ensure that agents remain relevant as industries evolve, minimizing the risk of outdated or inaccurate knowledge.</p>
