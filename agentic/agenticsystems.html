        <section id="challenges">
          <h2>The Challenges of Current Enterprise Software Systems</h2>
          <p>The current enterprise software landscape is characterized by several key challenges that hinder user experience and productivity:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Organizational Silos Over User Experience</strong>: Traditional enterprise systems are often built according to organizational structures rather than the needs of the user experience journey. For example, CIOs, CHROs, CFOs, and CMOs each develop their own systems, leading to a fragmented ecosystem where users must navigate multiple platforms to accomplish tasks. This siloed approach creates friction and inefficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Brittle Workflows</strong>: Enterprise systems are typically designed with pre-determined workflows that users must follow. These rigid workflows do not accommodate the diverse needs of users, forcing them to adapt their processes to fit the system rather than the other way around. As a result, the systems are brittle and fail to support dynamic, evolving workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnected User Experience</strong>: Users often find themselves jumping between disparate systems to complete a single task. This fragmented experience disrupts productivity and increases cognitive load, as users must constantly switch contexts and relearn interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent Data and User Experience</strong>: The lack of integration across enterprise systems leads to inconsistencies in data and user experience. Different systems may present conflicting information, creating confusion and reducing trust in the software.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        
        <section id="promise">
