This gap led to the emergence of reasoning models, the next step in the machine learning evolution.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="reasoning-models">
          <h2>Reasoning Models: The Next Logical Step</h2>
          <p>To address the limitations of LLMs, reasoning models were developed to handle more complex cognitive tasks. These models build on the foundational capabilities of LLMs while incorporating features that enable them to perform tasks requiring deeper thought and contextual understanding.</p>
          
          <h3>Defining Features of Reasoning Models:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Handling Larger Contexts:</strong> Reasoning models excel at processing and retaining larger amounts of information. This allows them to operate on tasks requiring deep contextual understanding over multiple layers of complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Solving Challenging Problems:</strong> These models are adept at tackling complex math, science, and logical reasoning problems. By iterating over problems multiple times, they refine their outputs to ensure accuracy and consistency.</li>

          </ol>
          
          <h3>Examples of Reasoning Models:</h3>
          <p>OpenAI's o1 models are a prime example, showcasing improved reasoning capabilities compared to traditional LLMs. The soon-to-be-released o3 models are expected to set new benchmarks in problem-solving and advanced reasoning. Despite these advancements, reasoning models remain largely confined to generating and processing information, lacking the ability to interact directly with the external world.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="action-models">
          <h2>Enter Action Models: A Seamless Future</h2>
          <p>The natural progression from reasoning models is the development of models that can take actions based on user-defined goals. Action models promise to be a game-changer by integrating the generative and reasoning capabilities of previous models with the ability to perform tasks in the real world. These models represent a shift from passively processing information to actively achieving user goals.</p>
          
          <h3>What Are Action Models?</h3>
          <p>Action models are an emerging category of machine learning systems designed to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Connect with External Services:</strong> Unlike current models, which operate in isolation, action models will integrate with external AI-native services. This allows them to perform tasks such as booking flights, scheduling appointments, or managing finances.</li>
            <li><strong>Take User-Defined Actions:</strong> Users will be able to define high-level goals, and the action model will autonomously plan and execute steps to achieve those goals. For example, organizing a holiday, managing budgets, or planning events could be entirely handled by these systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate and Negotiate:</strong> Action models will engage in continuous feedback loops with the user, refining their actions and negotiating with external services to deliver optimal outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan and Orchestrate Steps:</strong> Action models will differ from current agents built on LLMs and reasoning models by incorporating planning and orchestration of steps as a core capability. This means they can autonomously manage multi-step tasks, ensuring seamless execution.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="practical-example">
          <h2>A Practical Example of Action Models in Use</h2>
          <p>Imagine a user who wants to plan a holiday based on specific preferences. An action model could:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Initiate a conversation with the user to understand their budget, preferred destinations, travel dates, and desired experiences.</li>
