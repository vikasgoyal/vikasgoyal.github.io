<h1><b>The Evolution of Machine Learning Models: From LLMs to Action Models</b></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Machine learning has seen
transformative changes in recent years, driven by the development of new
categories of models. Large language models (LLMs) have significantly
influenced natural language processing (NLP), followed by the emergence of
reasoning models, which excel at handling more complex tasks. Now, we stand on
the brink of a new frontier: action models. These models promise to extend the
capabilities of their predecessors by interacting with the external world,
taking meaningful actions, and seamlessly integrating into users' lives. In
this article, we explore this progression in depth, examining the capabilities,
challenges, and transformative potential of action models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>The Rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)</b></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>LLMs represent a groundbreaking
leap in the field of NLP. Based on transformer architectures, these models are
trained on massive datasets, enabling them to generate text that is coherent,
contextually relevant, and human-like. Their widespread adoption has
revolutionized multiple domains, pushing the boundaries of what artificial
intelligence can achieve in processing and generating human language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Key Contributions of LLMs:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Chatbots:</b> LLMs have powered conversational agents
     capable of understanding user input and providing helpful, context-aware
     responses. From customer support systems to personal virtual assistants,
     chatbots have benefited immensely from the contextual depth that LLMs
     provide.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Language Translation:</b> Services like Google
     Translate have incorporated LLMs to improve the quality and fluency of
     translations. By grasping subtle nuances in language, LLMs ensure more
     accurate and context-sensitive outputs.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Text Generation:</b> From creative writing and content
     summarization to drafting emails and legal documents, LLMs have showcased
     their ability to assist in a variety of content generation tasks,
     democratizing access to high-quality written communication.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, despite their
transformative capabilities, LLMs have limitations. While adept at
understanding and generating text, they struggle with tasks requiring advanced
reasoning, deep contextual understanding over extended text, or iterative
problem-solving. This gap led to the emergence of reasoning models, the next
step in the machine learning evolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Reasoning Models: The Next Logical Step</b></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>To address the limitations of
LLMs, reasoning models were developed to handle more complex cognitive tasks.
These models build on the foundational capabilities of LLMs while incorporating
features that enable them to perform tasks requiring deeper thought and
contextual understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Defining Features of Reasoning Models:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Larger Contexts:</b> Reasoning models excel at
     processing and retaining larger amounts of information. This allows them
     to operate on tasks requiring deep contextual understanding over multiple
     layers of complexity.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Solving Challenging Problems:</b> These models are
     adept at tackling complex math, science, and logical reasoning problems.
     By iterating over problems multiple times, they refine their outputs to
     ensure accuracy and consistency.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Allocating Computational Resources:</b> Reasoning
     models intelligently allocate additional computational resources to harder
     tasks. This enables them to spend more time on challenging problems,
     producing well-thought-out solutions that were previously beyond the
     capabilities of earlier models.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Examples of Reasoning Models:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>OpenAI's o1 models are a prime
example, showcasing improved reasoning capabilities compared to traditional
LLMs. The soon-to-be-released o3 models are expected to set new benchmarks in
problem-solving and advanced reasoning. Despite these advancements, reasoning
models remain largely confined to generating and processing information,
lacking the ability to interact directly with the external world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Enter Action Models: A Seamless Future</b></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The natural progression from
reasoning models is the development of models that can take actions based on
user-defined goals. Action models promise to be a game-changer by integrating
the generative and reasoning capabilities of previous models with the ability
to perform tasks in the real world. These models represent a shift from
passively processing information to actively achieving user goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What Are Action Models?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Action models are an emerging category of machine learning
systems designed to:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Connect with External Services:</b> Unlike current
     models, which operate in isolation, action models will integrate with
     external AI-native services. This allows them to perform tasks such as
     booking flights, scheduling appointments, or managing finances.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Take User-Defined Actions:</b> Users will be able to
     define high-level goals, and the action model will autonomously plan and
     execute steps to achieve those goals. For example, organizing a holiday,
     managing budgets, or planning events could be entirely handled by these
     systems.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Iterate and Negotiate:</b> Action models will engage in
     continuous feedback loops with the user, refining their actions and
     negotiating with external services to deliver optimal outcomes.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Plan and Orchestrate Steps:</b> Action models will
     differ from current agents built on LLMs and reasoning models by
     incorporating planning and orchestration of steps as a core capability.
     This means they can autonomously manage multi-step tasks, ensuring
     seamless execution.</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>A Practical Example of Action Models in Use</b></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Imagine a user who wants to plan a holiday based on specific
preferences. An action model could:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Gather Information:</b> Initiate a conversation with
     the user to understand their budget, preferred destinations, travel dates,
     and desired experiences.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Research Options:</b> Connect to AI-native travel
     platforms to explore available flights, accommodations, and activities
     that align with the user's preferences.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Negotiate and Optimize:</b> Communicate with various
     services to secure the best deals and schedules, potentially even bundling
     offers for maximum value.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Keep the User Informed:</b> Provide real-time updates,
     suggest alternatives, and finalize bookings only after receiving the
     user's approval.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>The result is a seamless, hands-free experience,
transforming the way users interact with AI systems and significantly reducing
the manual effort required to achieve complex goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Challenges in Building Action Models</b></h2>
